	 * <p>In the case of implementations that are creating a singleton object,
	 * this method should try to avoid singleton creation as far as possible;
	 * it should rather estimate the type in advance.
	 * For prototypes, returning a meaningful type here is advisable too.
	 * <p>This method can be called <i>before</i> this FactoryBean has
	 * been fully initialized. It must not rely on state created during
	 * initialization; of course, it can still use such state if available.
	 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Autowiring will simply ignore FactoryBeans that return
	 * {@code null} here. Therefore it is highly recommended to implement
	 * this method properly, using the current state of the FactoryBean.
